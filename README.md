# LinearRegression-on-Iris-Dataset
The GitHub repository showcases the implementation of Linear Regression on the classic Iris dataset. Through this project, we aim to predict the species of iris flowers based on their sepal and petal measurements. Leveraging the simplicity and interpretability of Linear Regression, the analysis provides insights into the relationship between the input features and the target variable. The repository includes detailed documentation of the data preprocessing steps, model training, evaluation metrics, and visualization of results. With clear explanations and visual representations, this project serves as a valuable resource for understanding the fundamentals of regression analysis and its application to real-world datasets.
